                Depression is a complex and often invisible condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and
                functions in daily life. Early understanding and awareness can make a crucial difference. This dashboard
                offers an anonymous and secure way to explore and predict the risk of depressive disorder using a
                HistGradientBoosting machine learning model. It highlights key contributing factors from real-world data
                and presents clear, explainable results to support mental health reflection and action. </p>

        <p class="mt-8 text-center">
            Everyone experiences low points â€” it's a natural part of being human. Feeling down, anxious, or overwhelmed
            doesn't make someone weak or broken. These emotions are valid and often signal that we need rest, support,
            or a change in our environment.

            Acknowledging that you're not okay is not a failure, but a form of strength. It's the first step toward
            healing, reflection, and growth. Whether you're navigating a tough period or supporting someone who is,
            remember: you don't have to go through it alone.
